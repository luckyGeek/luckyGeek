Q: I can't download any image and I have an empty page in my PDF-file.
A: Allow luckyGeek.jar access to internet through your firewall.

Q: I can't execute any *.bat on Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8.
A: Since Windows Vista user account control (UAC) want to protect user for execution of batch-files (*.bat.)
   To execute these files right-click on a *.bat and select "Run as administrator".
